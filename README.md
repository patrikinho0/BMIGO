# BMIGO - A Mobile BMI Calculator App 📱

BMIGO is an app that allows users to calculate their body mass index (BMI) and track their progress over time. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, and it can indicate the health status of a person. 

With BMIGO, users can:

- Input their height and weight in either metric or imperial units and get their BMI and corresponding health status instantly. 📏
- Input their BMI with the date and status and save it in the app. 💾
- View their BMI history in a table or a chart and see their changes over time. 📈
- Set their BMI goals and get motivated to achieve them. 🎯

BMIGO is built with Android Studio, using Kotlin as the programming language. It uses Firebase as a database to store the user's data.
